# Easy Home Wand

> Easy Home Wand is a relatively easy to obtain item mod which allows you to set multiple teleportation coordinates (homes). Equipped with custom sounds, textures and recipes.

> To set a home, you must right click with the wand (which will activate a foil.)

> To teleport to a home, you must left click on a wand with a home set. You will be given Teleport Fatigue, which prevents you from using the wand for 5 minutes. This is a mob effect which can be removed with a bucket of milk.
