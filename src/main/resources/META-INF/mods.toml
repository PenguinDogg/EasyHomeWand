Easy Home Wand is a relatively easy to obtain item mod which allows you to set multiple teleportations (homes). Equipped with custom sounds, textures and recipes.

To set a home, you must right click with the wand (which will activate a foil.)

To teleport to a home, you must left click on a wand with a home set. You will be given Teleport Fatigue, which prevents you from using the wand for 5 minutes. This
is a mob effect which can be removed with a bucket of milk.

If you like the mod, make sure to support it on CurseForge, it helps a lot.
